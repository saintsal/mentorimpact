Musenga Siliwa has an engineering degree from Zambia's most prestigious university, so nobody understands why he's working with the labourers in the dirt.

Musenga Siliwa had an technical inspiration that would tackle food production in Zambia.

After a hard-faught career, working with Zambia's engineering elite, Musenga Siliwa banished himself to to a farm to dig.

It's hard for an African engineer to explain why he's working with the labourers in the dirt.

If you've been lucky enough to be the one chosen among your siblings to go to school, and smart enough to win a university scholarship, and hard-working enough to turn that into a prestigious career, then why would you go back and work as a labourer?

Musenga Siliwa was calling me from back home in Zambia.  He was standing on a farmer's porch, looking at a small-scale corn field with dirt under his fingernails.

I could imagine his signature smile, big and wide with friendly eyes, as he told me: "You know Sal, I've learned exactly how to improve my applicator, and I learned that farmers don't buy it for fertiliser efficiency, but to avoid pilfering.  It's really good. This farmer won't let me leave unless I sell him my prototype!  He's insisting.  He even offered me more money.  But let me tell you Sal, I don't think working on farms is going to be a good way to grow my sales."

I wasn't sure if this was Zambian humour.  In either case, Musenga went on to pre-sell over 25,000 units that year.

Usability testing is deeply undervalued by people who haven't tried it.  Like most forms of deep customer contact, it takes doing it to have those aha moments, to get some insight where you now know what to focus on to get your business on the right track.

Musenga had sat through a few weeks of startup and design training.  Well-built with a clean-shaven head, he'd sat quietly at the back of the classes.  Noticeably, he wasn't smiling.  It was a little intimidating.

At first, I thought, this stuff isn't right for him.  It was my first time teaching in Sub-Saharan Africa, and it was clear that a lot of our Anglo-Saxon ways weren't relevant here.

So I'd talk to him one-on-one, and as I learned about his product, a farm implement designed to double the efficiency of applying fertilizer with seeds. Fertilizer in the backpack attached to a hand-held tube system that looks like a walking stick.  Each time you plant your walking stick in the ground, and it buried a seed surrounded in fertiliser at the perfect depth.

As an engineer, Musenga was focused on the mechanical systems and the efficiency of fertilizer.  As an academic, he was managing the relationships between two universities for his project.  He wasn't aware of farmers' buying mentalities, and he didn't place much weight on the needs of the labourer, his end user.

It wasn't a knowledge problem - he had been taught about "understanding customers" and "user experience" already - it was an action problem.  This wasn't an education challenge, it was a mentoring challenge.
