# Acknowledgements

Mentor Impact is the result of contributions from helpful and open mentors. 

### Super-mentors
First and foremost, thanks to the super-mentors -- those that startups recommended to their accelerator without prompting! Adam Paulisick, Johanna Kollmann, Rose Lewis, Stephen Rapoport, Jens Lapinski, Jim Mann, and the others who've helped along the way. 

### Collaborators
Thanks to Rob Fitzpatrick for helping with the early writing up.  Thanks to Robbert Van Geldrop and Len Welter for being among the first mentors to run with Mentor Impact, and for the feedback to help make this more useful for new mentors.

Thanks to Jan Matern, Marc Davies and Emil Wallner at the Emerge Education accelerator for kicking off this project with us. Thanks to the support we received from other accelerators we work with: Carlos Eduardo Espinal at Seedcamp, Jon Bradford and Jess Williamson at Techstars, Rumen Iliev at LauncHub, Emma Cheshire at dotForge; for intros and support.

Thanks to Marina Del Castell for the fun cover photo. 

# The Source Institute Research Process

Our process in gathering these best practices is on-going. The best mentors are constantly evolving, and a lot depends on culture. This guide should evolve to match.

We've seen the One True Way attitude become harmful in many cases; as certain practices become popular, they become calcified, misrepresented, and outdated. Good advice turns into one-liners, and those one-liners get applied without context.  This becomes harmful.  At Source Institute, we choose approaches that keep context.

We started by looking for people who'd positively impacted successful startups, according to the founders.  At the time, I worked directly with around 20 accelerators, including Seedcamp and the team that was bringing Techstars to London. I asked the programme managers and directors, "who are the mentors that constantly make a big difference? Who are the ones that have founders raving and recommending?" I also went to some of the startups that were clearly growing. I asked them if there were any mentors that played a significant role for them.


The process then involved weeks of depth interviews with these mentors.  I always started with a beginners' mind, like a new apprentice, and asked them to walk me through everything they did. These interviews each took hours. 

From individual interviews, I developed interactive workshop for other mentors to learn and contribute to the body of knowledge, where new mentors could add to the content as we taught it - in an open, discussion format.

By now, I've spoken with more than 200 of these mentors either individually or in small groups and have aggregated their remarks and approaches into this booklet. 

Huge thanks to all the mentors who contributed!

## Help Us Make This Guide Better!

One point that stood out is how many styles of good mentoring exist. There is no One True Way, but awareness of different approaches is likely to help you improve your own. 

Source Institute guides are community works, and the book form is only a single facet. Mentor Impact is also a workshop and an online forum.

## Is there a single way to be a good mentor?
There are a lot of commonly held ideas of good mentoring:

* Being a sounding board
* Being the voice of reason
* Helping them decide
* Inspire them to take action
* Being Socratic
* Bringing expertise
* Providing emotional support

One of the best mentors we interviewed, who was also a founder who went through an accelerator, says:

> “Listen. Let them explain before giving advice, fully understanding what they do, and what stage they're at.  Give us ideas but not advice.  

> Telling us what to do has been a bad experience.” 

There are different views and guidelines for how to "mentor right." When we reverse-engineered good mentoring by asking the most impactful mentors we could find, a lot of them disagreed with these commonly-accepted guidelines.

Whether you agree or not, they're a good starting point for discussion and self-awareness.

# Good mentoring is just...
A lot of what's in here might seem obvious or familiar. A lot is simple stuff that too often goes forgotten, to the detriment of the founders we're all trying to help. 

A few accomplished corporate leaders, like Len Welter at Markit, have realised that good mentoring is a lot like good people management. It's true!

For your skills to translate, a few tweaks and a bit of startup-specific awareness will help you be effective. 

Mentor Impact is designed to be a small investment that will quickly return on both your and your mentees time. It covers nuances that often mean the difference between time wasted on polite noises, and delivering true, immediate value.

Think of Mentor Impact as a review, and a repurposing of your skills for the very specific case of startup mentoring.

## What separates great mentors from the rest 

Our research shows top startup mentors often have contradictory approaches to each other.  But one consistency is that top mentors have a considered, deliberate approach.

**They know their style, and they have a strategy they consistently apply to their mentoring.**

To make best use of this guide, reflect on:

* your strengths and your style
* your game-plan for each mentor meeting

Instead of offering a prescriptive process, we've done our best to represent the different approaches top mentors use.

We'll lay out what works for them, and hopefully you'll adopt some of their ways to improve your own mentoring.  


## Styles of mentoring

We found that mentors who made a difference had reflected on their own style.  They'd thought about why they do what they do.

As we go over some of the differences, ask yourself, what's *your* style?

Some mentors prefer a collaborative tone, looking forward together.  Others like to be a contrary voice.

Some mentors like to hear pitches so they can quickly get a sense of the business.  Others find that starting with the pitch makes it tough to return to a transparent, honest conversation.

Some mentors like to "meet them where they are" and help unpack the problem as the founder sees it.  Some jump ahead, trying to push the founders to see there's more to it than what they're thinking now.


## Wielding Authority
Your authority is a dangerous thing.

One of the biggest hurdles you'll face is how this authority distorts your advice and filters feedback to you.

If you've been invited to mentor a startup, it's probably because you:

  * Are an experienced founder
  * Have a useful skill
  * Have relevant connections
  * Have particular domain expertise
  * Are a potential investor

In most cases, founders will not distinguish between your flippant comments and when you're speaking from deep expertise. 

In some accelerators, founders will treat all mentors as investors, selling themselves and presenting a only the positive.

This is known as the Halo Effect.

**The Halo Effect:** When your judgement of someone’s advice in any subject is influenced by your opinion of them in another subject. 

A typical scenario is when a founder is struggling with a troubled relationship at home, and ends up asking advice from a financially successful mentor who's been divorced 4 times.

When you're aware of this, a lot becomes obvious.

Sometimes, you'll find out weeks later that they missed the main point you made, but ran with an off-the-cuff idea that you forgot about. Others, you'll feel they're asking what to do in situations where you're not really an expert.

You'll also notice how you react to questions our of your expertise.  Do you stop giving advice and start asking questions? Do you recommend a more relevant mentor? 

> “Asking Socratic questions just doesn't work for me. I decide in advance what are the top 3 ways my experience can help them.
> I'm brutally honest about those things, and I don't answer questions that don't fall in my Top 3.”

> Stephen Rapoport, Founder of Pact Coffee & Crashpadder

Don't slip into the trap of answering every question with equal conviction. The founders will weigh everything you say similarly and will confuse your expertise with your opinion.

> "Clearly separate opinion from fact."

>  Techstars Mentor Manifesto


## Inclusiveness

Mentoring is about helping them, but to do that, you need to know their weaknesses. To do that, you need to earn their trust.

Depending on the startup founder, their perception of you, and the culture in your part of the world, there will be different ways to set a straight-talking, trusting tone. 

A quick way to build trust is to make the founder feel included.

If you're a founder too, then there's an instant common ground.  If you're an investor, you probably have strong relationships with founders.  If you're a corporate exec, you know the pressure of targets and dependency on people.

There's always a way to welcome them to your club, or to make them feel like they will fly under your wing.

Not all mentors use this approach - some prefer to challenge founders. Those that rely on founder's volunteering key information though, they tend to be inclusive.


# The Conversation

While mentoring styles are hugely varied, we've found the best mentors tend to work through 3 phases in every conversation:

1. Calibration - understanding the situation and where you can help most
1. Knowledge transfer - conveying what you know in a way that compels them
1. Next steps - helping them put decisions to action

Some mentors spend their entire time asking calibration questions.  They simply keep quizzing, evaluating the situation their mind, and the mentee learns how they think, almost through osmosis.

Others, like Stephen Rapoport, make quick work of calibration and knowledge transfer. He likes to get practical and focuses on taking action.

We've seen that most great mentors generally find a balance through these phases.

# 1. Calibration  

Amsterdam, 2011. I've just wrapped up the Leancamp track at The Next Web conference, and we know it's a hit because of the crowd that's gathering around.

We stand at the front of the auditorium, and answer questions for almost an hour after the conference is over. 

We like to help founders, so we keep going - out for drinks in Amsterdam.  It's going to be a big night.

I'm talking to a quiet but persistent guy about his business idea.  Seems little unfocused, a little too complicated, like most first-timers who haven't quite launched yet. I like him though, so I've given him the better part of this drinking time.  

We move to to the topic of advisors, and he explains his advisory board includes senior management at a few multi-national media companies.

"Wait, what?" I hand him his beer from the bar, "what stage are you at?"

And then I realise I've assumed based on his shy demeanor that he's pre-launch, but he's actually seeing steep revenue growth. I've been giving him the wrong advice.

He name is Paul Rawlings, and by then he had started Sreach, well on its way to becoming a multi-million pound tech company.

Paul smiles shyly, and I embarrassingly offer a cheers to his success.

If someone is deciding which idea to choose, then giving them your opinion may actually be quite helpful. But if they're already committed and are trying to improve execution, they need a very different sort of input. 

Calibration is a deliberate stage in the mentoring conversation that allows you to know where they are and where you can best help.  Our best mentors do this consistently, since it ensures their advice is as relevant and timely as possible.

You'd be shocked at how much startup advice gets given by folks who don't actually know where the startup stands.

To do this, you need to know:

* what do they do?
* how far along are they?
* what's on their mind?
* what resources do they have?

Note that calibration is an active process; you can't get there by sitting back and listening to a pitch, though that can be a good place to start.

Usually, calibration begins with simple conversation starters:

> "What are you guys building?"

> "How far along are you?"

> "How can I help?"

And some probing questions:

> "Why are you building this?"

> "How do you spend your day?"

> "What's the bottleneck?"

If you do just this much, you're already in the top tier of mentors. 

Everyone has their own take on calibration. Here are some of the favourites we've gathered so far.

> "Show me what you're stuck on."

> "What are your goals and targets for the next week, month and year?"

> "What worries you?"

> "Tell me what you're doing."
    
How do you calibrate?  Take a moment to reflect and write down some of your regular calibration questions.


> "Listen. Let them explain before giving advice, fully understanding what they do and what stage they're at."

In the rest of this section on calibration, we'll look a specific areas that important to understand when calibrating for startups.


## Learning their ambitions

People start businesses for different reasons.  It's a mistake to assume they're driven by growth, money, social impact, reputation, or lifestyle.

Our best mentors, even the most opinionated, ask questions like:

> "Why did you start this business?"

> "What motivates you to keep going?"

> "Where would you like to be in 5 years?"

> "Is this a business you plan to sell?"

It's easy to let definitions skew our understand and lead to assumptions.  People find their way into the world of startups from all angles so to them, terms like "startup" and "growth" have different meanings.  When they use these words, double check that you understand their implications as they see them.



## Figuring Out What The Product Actually Is

It's easy to make assumptions about a product or service based on a pitch, a website or a bio.  Calibration helps you shine a light to so you understand what they're making.

There's a really fast way to get straight to the point:

> "Show me the product."

Seeing it gives you a lot more information than relying on their description alone:

> "Tell me what you do."

In some cases, though, the product isn't representative of their goals.  Other mentors ask:

> "What's an ideal customer?"

> "Who are your competitors?"

> "Why are you building this?"

> "What's the problem you're solving?"

> "In 3 years time, how will your customers lives be improved?"

## Hearing the pitch 

Some mentors like to hear the pitch.

> "Give me your customer pitch."

Be wary though. Pitches come with 2 problems:

1. They can cover up the actual facts.
1. They can change the conversation from an open tone to selling and objection responses.

For example, if you hear, "I'm building a turn-key interactive advertising tool for consumer brands that dramatically increases viewer engagement," then how do you help them? 

From this, you can infer they need help with their value proposition, but this might not be their main problem.

They could have a great product and great growth . Or they could need help with customer referrals.  Their product could be completely misaligned to customer need, or considered essential for a small group of jargon-loving advertisers.

The pitch can be a great place to start, but it requires further probing and a stronger tone of inclusiveness to work from there.

On the other hand, a lot of the best mentors cut off pitches altogether, especially at the beginning of the meeting, so they can get the founder to open up.

> "Hey, you don't need to pitch me. I'm here to help, not to buy."


## Learning What Stage They're At

> "What are they trying to achieve? Where's the pain point? If they're past this, What's their traction position? What are they measuring? Why are they taking that approach?"

> Jens Lapinski

Startups evolve through distinct stages and need different types of help at each. You can usually get at the stage by asking simple questions like:

> "How far along are you guys?"

> "How many people are using it?"

> "How many are paying you?"

> "How much money have you raised?"

### Traction

Traction questions are a quick and effective way to figure out where they're at, although be aware that a pre-launch team may get defensive about being pushed too hard to answer "zero".

> "Have you launched?"

> "How many active users do you have?"

> "What about paying customers?"

> "How many customers are in the sales pipeline?" 

### Metrics

If they need product help and optimisations, then looking at their metrics is a great way to pinpoint the problem and offer good suggestions. 

> "What are you measuring at the moment?"

> "Do you have any targets?"
    
Some mentors find it useful to probe for specific numbers:

*CAC* Customer Acquisition Cost - the cost of acquiring a single customer, differs by channel

*LTV* Customer Lifetime Value - the calculated value of a customer over their lifetime.  Useful in subscription and marketplace businesses. Differs by marketing channel and customer segment.

*MAU* *WAU* Monthly and Weekly Active Users - how many people are actually using the product.  The key here is how this number is trending over time.

Some teams know which numbers they're struggling with, and other times you can use Dave McClure's Pirate Metrics as a quick scan:

**Acquisition**: What's the cost of acquiring a customer from different channels?

**Activation**: What percentage of the people who are exposed to the product convert into users by signing up? 

**Retention**: Of the people who sign up, how long do they stick around? 

**Revenue**: How much top-line revenue is coming in? In many cases, revenue per user is an important metric to track over time.

**Referral**: How many customers bring in other customers?  For businesses that rely on referrals to grow, the *viral co-efficient* or *k-factor* is a more accurate predictor. That's the percentage of customers who refer, multiplied by the percentage of referred people who become customers.

### Structured stages
Stages differ according to context, and different methodologies can give you a fast way to evaluate stage.

For example, enterprise software tends to go through Customer Development stages:

1. Problem identification
1. Early-adopter customer using their system
1. Selling to their first market
1. Selling to multiple markets
1. Transitioning to standardised operations to grow

Consumer software tends to follow different stages.  If they're going for growth, founders like Paul Buchhiet, creator of GMail, offers different stages:

1. Release a first version
1. Improve it until a core group loves it
1. Scale the user base
1. Scale the team

However, if the founders growth ambitions are directed more towards their individual independence than a big payoff, the stages might look more like Amy Hoy's recommendations:

1. Research the needs of a niche customer segment
1. Launch an educational product
1. Launch a subscription service

Keep in mind that it's not about educating the founders about these stages just yet. These are for you to get a sense of their stage so you know what matters now.

If you're aware of relevant stages for your founder's context and goals, that framework can guide your questions.  You can quickly understand the startup's current position.


## Finding Their Problems

While sometimes you'll disagree with what the founder thinks they need, it's almost always worth getting their view on their own top priorities. Known problems are quick to unearth and founders tend to be much more willing to act on them.

> "Show me what you're stuck on."

> "What are your goals and targets for the next week/month/year?"

> "What worries you?"

> "What's the current/next big focus?"

> "What's the bottleneck?"

> "How can I help?"

> "What are you spending your time on at the moment?"

## Mental State

The founder's mental state can also tell you what sort of help they need.

* Are they overwhelmed or confused? They may need help getting a broader perspective or talking to an industry expert.
* Are they stuck in ideation? They may need help picking a next action.
* Are they doing a little bit of everything? That tends not to be an effective strategy; they may need to be shown the options and pushed to decide what they won't do.
* Are they doing great and scaling well? They may just need intros and resources.


## Team Dynamics

> "How do you guys make decisions?"

> "Who is handling the customer/investor relationships?"

> "Any big fights yet?"

> "What are your responsibilities?"

> "Why did you each get into this business?"

> "Where do you each see yourselves in 10 years?"

When the core team is misaligned, the whole company is at risk.  In some cases, external pressure will cause the team to explode. In others, the business turns into a zombie, never able to move forward because the founders are constantly locking horns.

One common warning sign: when you're talking to a team of founders and the same person is answering every question, it's worth figuring out why. Watch the others' facial expressions.

Single out the other founders with questions and cut off the spokesman if they jump in. Ask the others for their view on a question the talkative one just answered. If something seems off, find time alone with the various individuals.


##  Customer Understanding

Get a sense of the customers' perspective, and the team's understanding of it.

> "What have your users said about that?"

> "How often are you running user tests?"

> "Has anyone committed to pay for it when it launches?"


## Constraints
I've sat at mentoring tables alongside some very accomplished people. SVPs of operations, managing partners of PR agencies, sought-after designers. I've watched the founders sit quietly, taking in everything they can at these rare opportunities to learn from the best.  

And I've talked to those founders later to learn that everyone's time was wasted. 

That operations advice was great, if they had more than $100,000 in operational capital available.  

That PR advice was perfect, if they had a day per week to invest in relationship building with journalists.  

That design advice was really what they needed, but the learning curve for that leading-edge technique proved too daunting.

It's important to understand their constraints, so you make sure your advice is something they can apply. 

Get a sense of time and financial constraints.

> "How long before cash becomes an issue?"

> "What are you spending your time on?"

Get a sense of what they can do and what they can't.

> "Who's on your team and what are they good at?"

### Founder-business fit
If it's an early-stage startup, watch out for strategies they don't have the skills or motivation to execute. 

Sometimes founders will ask a question about the business ("Should we sell to consumers or enterprises?") when really it's a human question ("Would we prefer running a product company or a sales company?"). They're so stuck in the numbers that they've forgotten that one of the options involves becoming a sales guy.

Sometimes there's a misfit between their personal goals and their funding choices. For example, someone who feels pressure to buy a house for their new family might be taking venture capital and reluctantly choosing a higher-risk path than they'd like.  

In these cases, they're too close to the problem to see it. Your outside perspective can be helpful.  

## The power of calibration

> “I’ve never sat down with a mentor who didn’t offer advice.  When I mentor, sometimes they’re way ahead of me, so I can’t help them.”

> Jim Mann

Jim Mann is a consistently top-rated mentor, because he's also a founder that's been through the accelerator. He often doesn’t give advice. He fights the impulse to give advice, and focuses on understanding them. The value comes from his questions.

In his case, asking questions is enough.  There's no need to move to transferring his knowledge in a more obvious way.  

Founders leave Jim with much greater clarity of their business, a compelling sense of what to do next, and ownership of their own destiny.

## Concluding Calibration

Remember, the point of calibration is to find the right match between their immediate needs and your experience.

You'll want to get a sense of:

* what do they do?
* how far along are they?
* what's on their mind?
* what resources do they have?

Good calibration reveals this so you know where you can help most.

Knowledge transfer, up next, is about making it happen. Before we move on though, here's what calibration might look like in practice:

**Mentor**: "Hi, I'm Sal. I can help with building communities, remote teams, learning from customers, and speeding up tough decisions. How can I help?  *A classic start, allowing the founder to decide where I'll be most useful.*

**Founder**: "Maybe it'll help if I start with a bit about us. We're democratising mobile money with a suite of exchange services that empower Kenya's consumers to control their own finances." *This is quite a salesy start with little content, but it gives us an idea of their selling skill and their target market.*

**Mentor**: "Wow. I like that ambition. I'm not an investor so there's no need to sell me. So I can help, could we start with what's your actual product?" *Trying to step the conversation out of sales mode and set a more open, collaborative tone.* 

**Founder**: "Sure. It's a service to exchange mobile money, data and airtime across Kenya's mobile networks. It works over the web and SMS." *Much better; this gives us some real information.*

**Mentor**: "How far along are you guys?" *Looking for a sense of their stage.*

**Founder**: "We've been working on it for about 9 months." *This is a typical sort of answer that doesn't actually tell you anything. Go deeper!*

**Mentor**: "Have you launched?"

**Founder**: "We're in beta." *Okay, so now we know they have a semi-working product at least. We still need more so I'll ask about traction.*

**Mentor**: "Great! How many people are using it?"

**Founder**: "We have several thousand customers." *This hard number gives you a sense of their stage. But the term customer is vague so we can learn more by exploring.*

**Mentor**: "What else are you measuring?"

**Founder**: "Revenue, which is rising, and number of transactions per day." *The founder isn't fully disclosing to us, but that's okay for now. We're learning where she's focusing.*

**Mentor**: "Nice to see a startup making money! Any idea how much of that revenue growth is from repeat customers?"

**Founder**: "I'm not sure..." *There are very useful measurements she can learn from us, but we want save that for later and keep calibrating.*

**Mentor**: "No problem. We can come back to that later. I remember when I started my conference business. All I watched was ticket sales and cash. I was so worried about going bankrupt!" *Being inclusive - I've been there too! Welcome to the club!*

**Founder**: "We're building our cash reserves.  At the moment, if any of the phone networks change their policies, some of our exchange products become unavailable for a while and our revenue dips." *A major worry revealed! And an indication of a key constraint: cash on hand.*

**Mentor**: "Does that happen a lot?" *Gauging the severity of the problem.*

**Founder**: "It's happened a few times so far.  We're starting to know a few key people at the big phone companies now, but not everyone." *Good find. This indicates an issue with the team's skills and network.*

**Mentor**: "Who's responsible for that? Actually, can you tell me the roles of everyone?"

**Founder**: "I handle the network relationships. I'm the CEO.  Davis writes our code and manages the systems.  Mercy is our web designer. Joseph runs our finances."  *You can infer a lot from the role definitions, like web designer, and also from the roles that are missing.*

**Mentor**: "What are your priorities this month?" *This feels like we already got the answer - build cash reserves, but this open ended version of the question allows us to double check and get the whole list.*

**Founder**: "We're launching a new website because we're getting a lot of press.  And I'm looking into a new product line."  *It's a common case - the team's activities don't align with their priorities. Another good find from calibration, but we're not quite done yet.*

**Mentor**: "Interesting.  Why's that?"

**Founder**: "So we can earn more from the same customer base. Our marketing costs are pretty high right now, and the more exchange services we have, the easier we make life for our customers." *Here we learn a key and immediate challenge. The new product line may not be where we think this founder should focus, but we have a sense of the founder's phschology and underlying reasons.*

At this point, five minutes of calibration have exposed a number of immediate ways we can help. Plus we have a sense of how this founder thinks and they have a sense that we understand them.  

Now we can move on to helping with Knowledge Transfer.

# 2. Knowledge Transfer

If you tell a kid not to touch the hot stove, they're going to do it anyway. 

Learning is complex.  It involves understanding, categorising, contextualising and recalling. On top of that, entrepreneurship is a craft, like cooking. A lot must be learned by doing.

Knowledge transfer isn't as easy as telling someone what to do. And on top of that, we don't have much time.

New mentors often react instancly to a pattern or behaviour they see.  They hear something they think they've heard before, like "I'm doing a survey" and jump in with advice. Even if we've calibrated well, we'll still never have all the information that the founder has.  And we don't want to get into a position where we're making the decisions for them.

So we need ways to quickly convey our knowledge in a way where they can apply it.

Here are a few tricks and approaches top mentors use to great effect.

Again, our advice is to choose approaches that seem right for you, and try them. There's no One True Way for Knowledge Transfer, but great mentors consistently know the specific methods that work for them.

## Tell Stories Instead Of Giving Advice

When founders get together, we tell stories.  The structure of stories -- with a protagonist, a context, a challenge, a decision and an outcome -- makes it easy for us.  

Stories with this structure are a shortcut to learning for a few reasons:

* They're easy to parse and understand.
* The listener is able to compare their context to the context of the story.
* They're memorable. Stories are one of the best ways to enable recall at that perfect moment, when that knowledge is needed. *"Who was that lady who had the same problem? Oh yeah..."*

Plus, some issues are emotionally loaded. Say someone asks how much equity to give a late co-founder. You can tell he feels he built his company through blood, sweat and tears - nobody else should feel the right to "come in and take" a big share of that. 

You can tell him what you'd do and why you'd do it. If you tell him how you would split it, the advice is going to be politely received, but in his mind dismissed as inappropriate. 

There's an emotional blocker to your sound advise, and it's easy to rationalise his choice to keep more equity.

Instead, you might tell a cautionary tale about a similar situation where the late-joining co-founder ended up with only 10% and years later quit the company in disgust when times got tough.  It just wasn't worth it anymore, and he realized what a rotten deal it had been. The original founder ended up with 90% of nothing. 

Or you might tell the story of a company with a similar split which lost their funding round in due diligence because the investors thought the CTO's small ownership stake was too much of a liability.

Now the mentee can compare these situations to his own. 

Are we raising investment? No, so this doesn't worry me. 

Are there tough time ahead?  Actually, that's likely, and sharing more of the pie at that point might make sense.  

Sometimes, it just takes a while for the story to sink in.

Sometimes, you'll know this is working when they ask questions, "is there any way to change the amount of equity based on how hard they work?" 

If we find we’re giving advice or recommendations, can we tell a story instead? Can we be clear about where we see a parallel and where we don’t? This allows the founder to ask the right questions, since they have more info about their context.

Jens Lapinski points out that we often have to be clear about the moral or lessons learned, so the message is conveyed.

The stories you know are mentoring assets.  They convey your knowledge *with depth and context*. 
They give founders structure to make their own decisions, and help them remember your experience right when they need it.

**Tip:** If you want to cultivate your story-telling ability, pick up the book Squirrel Inc. by Steve Denning. He's the creator the Knowledge Management department of the World Bank; he found story-telling was the foundation of his success.


## Bring the industry numbers

This team was waiting for me. They knew I had contacts. Their sales were low, their cash was running out, and they wanted my help to super-charge their sales pipeline.  They told me they weren't good at sales.

So I looked at their sales pipeline.  It actually looked pretty good. I looked at their numbers. Their conversion rate was excellent.

I asked, "What's the problem here? These numbers look great."

They expected a 50% conversion rate and when they were unable to achieve that, they thought they were doing poorly.  

When I told them the good news, they said, "Well then, we need to close deals faster. We're running out of cash."  But they were closing multi-national companies with a HR-related product in less than 4 months. They were doing reasonably well. 

The problem was that their current business model, selling to large companies, didn't fit their funding.  

They were smart and hard-working, and the only reason they put themselves in this situation was they didn't have realistic expectations for enterprise sales conversion rates and cycle times.

They didn't have the benchmarks they needed. They didn't know the numbers.

There are 3 categories of numbers our best mentors bring:

* Benchmarks
* Trends
* Financial & growth models

Let's look at them individually.

### Benchmarks 
Let's put you in a hypothetical situation. 

If a founder is trying to decide between making money through freemium or advertising, you probably have an opinion. But you can easily help them form their own opinion by pointing out that the CPMs (what they can charge for 1000 ad views) for their audience are going to be around $5 and that freemium upgrade rates (the percentage of free users that start to pay) for this type of product tend to peak at 2%.  

These industry benchmarks help their decision making.


There are tons of useful industry benchmarks you can provide for a given industry or business model: clickthrough rates, profit margins, manufacturing time, shipping costs, fully-loaded cost of employees, how long it takes to raise money, sale cycle length, growth rates, etc.  Often, you can probably find the relevant numbers much faster than them. 

There are also numbers which are so well-known in their small niches that they're never published.  Like the length of a sale for different industries. But you know them.

Good benchmarks are surprisingly hard to find and you can deliver big value with the right ones.

### Models
Back to our advertising startup example.

Now that you've given them some benchmarks, you can run them through the different business models, plugging in their actual numbers, or using hypotheticals to illustrate the boundaries of viability.  

Start with their current number of active users, and plug in the industry-standard 2% upgrade rate to it.  Now they can see how much revenue that's worth.   Move over to the advertising model. Multiply the 5$ per 1,000 impressions industry standard to the number of their page views. 

Show them how to run the numbers and they can decide for themselves.

Jens Lapinksi has his own viability spreadsheets for various business models. He quickly punches them in to show them how financially viable their current idea is.

The most important rates and measures are revealed.  And they're compared to what's reasonable based on real experience.

### Trends

> "When I challenge them, I do it quantifiably. I look up the stats and facts and ask viability questions."

> Adam Paulisick

Adam prepares for each mentor meeting by searching and preparing relevant industry numbers.  He's an expert at finding them, so a few minutes of research gives him a slew of tabs revealing key industry trends in his browser before he's on a mentoring call.  

When you're mentored by Adam and Jens, scenarios are discussed with the benefit of the numbers speaking back to you. Scenarios are calculated, markets are sized. 

The data quickly directs them to viable strategies, and the founders leave with hard data that will help them make better choices from now on.

## Do It With Them

If they're telling you they're doing the right things but they aren't getting the results you expect, you need to roll up your sleeves and get to work with them. 

> "Show me the product."

> "Talk me through everything that happened in that sales meeting."

> "Let me read the email you sent."

You'll want to do it with them if you suspect that they're missing execution skills. 

Instead of saying, "You guys really need to simplify the signup flow," spend 5 minutes and wireframe it with them. Instead of advising that their presentation deck needs to be more professional, grab their computer and fix it. If a founder is nervous about a big lead that just hit their inbox, then sit beside them and co-write the email.

When teaching founders how to learn from customer conversations, there's nothing that beats getting a customer on speakerphone and doing it with them.  The books and workshops are a fine start, but the rate of learning goes to lightspeed when they hear you ask a few questions yourself.  They instantly see how it's done and can emulate it.

The same goes for UX or product advice.  If you can grab someone and usability test their app with them, they'll see how it's done right.  If you grab paper and pen to wireframe with them, you'll flush out design problems quickly.

## Simulate It

Simulations are particularly useful for interpersonal skill-building.

If they need help hiring or firing, play the employee. If someone's cold calls aren't converting, have them make a dummy call to you right now. If they're getting mixed signals from customer interviews, roleplay the customer and have them question you.


## Be Socratic

The Socratic Method is basically asking friendly, helpful questions to elicit critical thinking in your mentee.

Being a Socratic sounding board is so powerful that it is often referenced as the only right way to mentor. Our research shows it's far from ubiquitous among top mentors, but it is common.

> "How can we find out the best way to do that?"

> "What are some proxies you can use to size the market?"

> "What rules of thumb can you give your employees so they can act independently?"

If you're a guide, you don't expect to meet your client at the destination.  You pick them up, and show them the way.

> "Meet them where they are, not where you want them to be."

> Janice Fraser, founder of Adaptive Path and LUXR

When you're the expert, you'll spot a novice in the way they think.  Just giving them advice is like sending them directions and hoping for the best.  Expanding their thinking with Socratic questions, step by step, is guiding them along the path to mastery.


## Create Visuals

Visual communication is a powerful augmentation to conversations.  They add bandwidth since time is tight; visuals communicate more through spacial relationships and metaphors.  Since the same thing is being communicated in multiple ways, it's easier to catch misunderstandings, avoiding confusion or conveying the wrong idea.

### Use diagrams as feedback

If they need help with their platform strategy, draw it while they talk. Let them help. They'll see their own thinking reflected back, and spot incongruencies and new connections.

Use the shared drawing to help with calibration, and add their questions and your comments to the diagram. You can literally point as you speak, putting what you say into a context that's meaningful to them.

Using diagrams makes everything you say more concrete. 

### Use diagrams as maps

In mentor conversations, talking over diagrams is like generals discussing strategy over a map in a war room.  More than pointing, you can use sticky notes as pieces, moving them around to illustrate strategies.

A few examples:

John Mullins' 7 Domains Model helps put different early-stage risks in context.

Eric Ries' Build-Measure-Learn loop helps clarify the different steps in learning and adapting.

Reid Hoffman's Organisational Scale table helps describe when priorities and organisational layouts need to evolve.

By drawing them out with a felt pen in front of you, you're now talking over a commonly-understood map of the terrain.

### Use the Business Model Canvas as a war room

The Business Model Canvas is quick to draw on a sheet of paper, and in conversation is useful for:

* spotting risks
* finding incongruencies in founders' thinking
* putting recommendations into the context of the whole business

For example, "I can intro a founder who can help. She's good at customer service." This can interpreted in various ways.  Will she advise on building a customer service team, or improving specific customer touch-points?  By pointing to the key activities block, or channels block, you're communicating this context.  Or maybe you were offering the intro because you see they need to improve retention?  You'd point to the Customer Relationship block.

In terms of spotting risks and incongruencies, the business model canvas can reflect them:

> "Why are you charging SMEs a signup fee, when they're used to paying for this type of thing as a subscription?"

> "What use is this code base, when your paying customers don't get any value from it?"

By themselves, these questions come across as antogonistic challenges, while pointing to the ill-fitting parts on a canvas the founder described themself, they sound like rational inquiry.

Most startup founders will have seen the Business Model Canvas already, so be careful that it facilitates the conversation rather than being the point of it.

See businessmodelgeneration.com for more information.


### Option Cards

If someone is drowning in ideation or needs to see the options and make a decision, you can write them down one per index card or sticky note. They'll leave with a deck of clear possibilities and have an easier time choosing one.

See [optioncards.co](http://optioncards.co) for more information.

### Sketch Notes

A classic visual artifact is a sketch note - visual notes that cover the main themes.  Sketch notes stand out during a conversation because they add meaning to it, and stand out after because they're the easiest notes to scan and recall.

Sketch notes are much easier than most people think too. You can become proficient in about 30 minutes at 

[http://xplaner.com/visual-thinking-school/]( http://xplaner.com/visual-thinking-school/)

## Physical Artifacts
Physical artifacts are a memento, making it easy to remember the important details and act on your feedback.

Business cards work the same way. They're a physical artifact that says "follow up with me".

We want the equivalent artifacts that say "consider this", "decide this", "remember this", and "do this". 

### Books

Saul Klein, the founder of Index Ventures, has been known to walk out of mentor meetings early.  He'll quickly assess the founder, and detecting a skills gap, ask if they've read a certain book.

This might seem familiar so far, but the next step is where Saul turns this from a forgettable brush-off to the foundation of a meaningful relationship.

He pulls out the book in question, thunks it onto the table, and says, "I think this book is what you need right now.  I'll talk to you in a week about it."

If you're talking to teams whose problem you can anticipate and you have a relevant book (yours or otherwise), it can be a helpful gift.

### Tokens

Francesco Cirillo is the creator of the one of the world's most popular time management systems, The Pomodoro Technique.  He often gets asked time management questions, and with a bit of calibration, a bit of Socratic questioning, mentees realise they already knew the answer.

That *aha* moment sometimes feels embarrassing for them -- if they already knew the answer, why did they bother to ask? -- but Francesco is a lovely guy, and wants them to leave feeling empowered and encouraged.  

So he reaches into his bag and pulls out an official Pomodoro Timer, and signs it with a felt pen.

Now they have the tool they need sitting right on their desk, a positive reminder the next time they need it.


## A Kick In The Ass

> "I'm much more focused on the process of how they go about doing what they're doing. What are the names of their customers? Have they spoken to them? I'm assessing if they've done their job. I am blunt if I think they are crazy or deluding themselves."

> Jens Lapinski

Jens is experienced enough to have a sense of what responsibilities a founder has at different stages of their business.  He sees his role as a mentor as checking: are they doing their job?

In the Africa Prize For Engineering Innovation, we pair each founder (usually a first-timer) with a highly-accomplished engineering-led tech founder (serial, multi-million pound enterprises) for 6 months.They have weekly or fortnightly calls, and the founders often feel they need to work hard to live up to their mentors' expectations.

In both these cases, founders respond positively to these challenges and check-ins when they're done on a regular basis, every week or two.

Beware of a few problems if you choose this approach:

1. There's a fine line between giving them a good push, and running their business for them.
1. While regular meetings mean you can catch-up quickly and get working, you still need to re-calibrate every meeting.

## Be Enthusiastic!
Being a founder is lonely, and sometimes even experienced founders forget the times when they had serious doubts.

Some teams just need to re-kindle their confidence or excitement.  Sharing your passion and encouragement goes a long way.

This sort of help backfires if they're at a legitimate impasse or are missing key skills, but can be just the ticket if all they need to do is get excited and get running again.

## How To Help When They're Already Winning

Sometimes a startup is going super-well. The founders are amazing, growth is good, and the finances are under control. Maybe you can help with intros, but they really don't need your knowledge.

In cases like this, it's better to hold your hands up and take direction.

> "You're doing great here. Is there anything I can do to be helpful?"

> "Can I keep an eye out for anything or anyone that can help?" 


It's okay to offer no advice. I had a meeting recently with a founder whose only problem was in his new factory, how to do a special type of weld. I honestly couldn't help, so we talked about life over dinner. I learned a lot from him, and ended up interviewing him for our online course, The Sources.

> "The best mentor relationships eventually become two-way."

> Techstars Mentor Manifesto

It's hugely tempting to say something to fill the "role" as a mentor, but the Hippocratic Oath is relevant here. If you don't know how to help them, it's better to say nothing than to add more confusion.

## Concluding Knowledge Transfer

When we look for the best mentors, we don't look for ones who get the best ratings after the meeting.  We look for the ones who really changed a startup's direction for the better. 

Those mentors don't just talk, they convey their knowledge in a way that's actionable.

To help them decide for themselves:

* Use visuals
* Be socratic
* Show them their options
* Just be available as a friend

To give sharp advice:

* Calibrate well
* Distinguish between fact and opinion
* Ensure your advice matches their goals, industry, business model, and situation

To transfer your life experience:

* Tell stories
* Apply research and models
* Share benchmarks

To transfer your skills:

* Do it with them
* Simulate it

# 3. Next Steps

Knowledge is not enough.  Entrepreneurship is a contact sport, it's a craft that's learned through doing.

This reflects in our super-mentors conversations; they almost all made time to help their founders take action in each meeting.

The last phase of mentor conversation might be short, but it's important: next steps.

A quick caveat on next steps:  It's a good habit to allow the founders to confirm that's what they want before committing yourself.  There's nothing worse than needing to take a meeting or an intro just to be polite.

## The Insta-Intro

If you can pull out your phone and make an email intro right there in the meeting, the team will love you for actually moving them forward.

The main folks you can add value by intro-ing are:

* Industry expert (customer learning, possible advisor)
* Friendly customer (customer learning, alpha user, case studies)
* Big customer (sales)
* Relevant investors (if the timing is right)
* Press (if the timing is right)

But take a moment to ensure that the company understands what the intro is for and is able to take advantage of it immediately. If you're happy to make the intro, tell them so and ask whether they want it and how you should frame it.

## The Conditional Intro
Sometimes you'd be happy to make an intro, but the founders just aren't ready yet. 

Instead of promising something fuzzy like, "There are a couple people I can introduce you to when you're ready," tell them the following:

* Who you can intro
* Why you think it's relevant
* What they need to achieve in order for you to be happy doing so

This provides a clear sense of the resources at their disposal without false hope.  It also gives them immediate value, an understanding of what they need to do next.

## Homework

Let's say you're helping them improve their customer conversations or landing page design. You do-it-with-them or simulate it as much as is possible in the meeting, but it's impossible to cover everything. 

Tell them to go try it and loop back to you next week so you can catch mistakes and help them iteratively.

Set an appointment for this, so you can look it over and give them live feedback.

## The Reading List
When there are more relevant educational resources out there -- like books, blogs, online courses -- it's a better use of everyone's time if you simply make them a reading list.


## Ask For Updates
This is a stronger version of the friendly open door. 

Saying "let me know how I can help" tends not to work because founders don't know how you can help them. Instead, invite them to send you their weekly update, which lets you stay in the loop and proactively reach out to help with any problems you spot. 

If they aren't yet sending an update, a quick and useful format used by Seedcamp is to ask for their weekly PPPs: progress, problems, and plan.

## Becoming An Advisor
In the startup world, the terms advisor and mentor are somewhat reversed.  Advisor is used for ongoing relationships, whereas mentor is often a one-off conversation.

If you can offer significant ongoing help to the startup and if you get along well with the founders, an advisory relationship may make sense. Often, those come with a token equity stake in the company.

This rarely happens after the first meeting, but *can* happen after the second or third. If the team has caught your eye, use a combination of weekly email updates and additional meetings to look for an opportunity to add significant value.

One important caveat is that you need to be able to offer ongoing value. Making a batch of killer intros gets you good karma. Being able to keep doing that on a monthly basis for several years makes you a good fit as a potential advisor.

"Typical" terms for early-stage advisors are around 0.5-1% equity with 2-4 year vesting and full acceleration on exit. This just means that instead of getting the equity all at once, it's steadily dripped to you over the vesting period. If you and the company part ways early, you keep what you've earned and return the rest. The "acceleration on exit" means that if the company sells or IPOs before the vesting is done, you immediately get the full amount you were entitled to (and you can pat yourself on the back for doing a great job as an advisor).

# How Mentoring Goes Wrong

It's worth being aware of how your help is perceived.

When accelerators bundle their investment with a pool of mentors, you'll be perceived as part of a reporting system to the accelerator.  Often, they're playing along as a condition of their investment.  

While this isn't accurate or fair in many ways, it's often re-enforced by mentors who mean well, but give irrelevant advice. Mentoring can be seen by founders as a time-waster, but a necessary evil.

Let's look at this from the founder's point of view.

> "After I sit down at the table, we do introductions, and I pitch again.  The accelerator has given me a lot of pitch training (that's important to them) and this is good practice. My pitch will give you a sense of what I do.  The context of the meeting has implied that you, the mentor, are important, so I need to impress you. Maybe you're an investor, so I'll go with my investor pitch. 

> I'll probably get interrupted in my pitch quite a bit, but I'll answer politely.  Sometimes these judging questions find a hole in my thinking, but more often than not, I'm just clarifying something the mentor didn't understand. 

> This means that by the time you have a decent idea of what I do, there won't be much time left. You'll tell me, "this seems good, this seems bad."  I know that the accelerator values their relationship with you, so even though I probably won't ever see you again, I'll write down everything you say.  

> Plus, to be honest, I'm getting so much advice right now that I don't even know what's good or bad anymore.  Too many ideas, not enough real support.

> While I'm here at this mentoring day, I'm worried about sales follow-ups and if my team is on track with the new version -- I'll be getting right back to that tonight. I'm trying my best to pay attention to you though.

> The power dynamic means you're driving the agenda of this meeting. By now, you've sort of wrapped your head around my business and are getting excited; you see the potential and offer a bunch of suggestions and possibilities. 

> A lot of those seem good. I'm writing them down, but I know I won't get to review my notes for another few weeks at least."



That's a fairly common case, and it means that most advice is forgotten, but two or three ideas from different mentors might get a try-out. Most will be relegated to a long list of bullet points in a note that won't be seen again.

Every mentor has so much value to offer, yet this is the reality for many founders being mentored. It's a missed opportunity. 

Changing this comes down to mentoring skill, so let's recap.

Through our research, we learned there's a polar difference between:

1. Calibrate
1. Knowledge Transfer
1. Next Steps

which we've seen consistently applied by the few mentors who really changed things for startups consistently, and:

1. Pitch
1. Judge
1. Opinions and Advice

which is how the less-effective mentors see the process.

*Opinions and challenges* feel like our responsibility as mentors, but that's not our job.  Our job as mentors is to help them lead, and enable them to progress.

*Judging* tends not to be helpful for the founders unless it could end in you writing a cheque. The market is the only judge that matters. Help them bounce the idea of the market.

*Making a decision for the founder* is rarely appreciated. Ultimately, it's the founder's company. You can give them guidance to help them make a decision, but you shouldn't try to make it for them. 

> "Give us ideas, but not advice. Telling us what to do has been a bad experience."


# Picking Your Style

As we said in the intro, there is no strict process for being a good mentor. We expected some principles, like applying the Socratic Method, to be consistent, but there were too counter-examples that achieved outstanding results.

All the best mentors knew their style. They had though this through and could articulate it.  Their approach reflected their strengths. 

With these in mind, it's time to really reflect on how you can develop the best style to suit you:

* What do you want to get out of mentoring?
* Which stage and type of company can you best help? Which ones are you unable to help?
* What do you tend to assume?  How can you make sure you calibrate better for that?
* What about your experience could offer the most value to founders?
* What are the best ways to transfer that type of knowledge?
* What is your mentoring style? Are you Socratic or do you give sharp advice? Why? When?
* How would you spend the time of a 30 minute meeting?
* How would you deal with a never-ending pitch?
* Are you more interested in helping the founders with their goals or helping the business itself?


## Your Mentoring Kit
Some mentoring events will have stationary, but since artifacts are so important to knowledge transfer, it's best to bring what you'll need.

My kit has blank A4 paper, mini sticky notes, index cards, markers (whiteboard and permanent), and a few copies of my book on how to make faster decisions.


# Getting Better

If startup mentoring is something you want to get better at, you'll find yourself up against a feedback problem: no matter how excited folks are when the meeting ends, you can't tell if it actually helped for weeks or months. 

In most mentoring environments, you won't get to see them again to find out.

As such, doing lots of one-time mentoring tends to make us more confident without actually making us better. A dangerous combination for the founders we advise!

> "Adopt at least one company every single year. Experience counts." 

> Techstars Mentor Manifesto

To become a better mentor, you need an ongoing relationship with some of the teams. Without that, you'll never see where your help helps and where it doesn't.

## Learn from other mentors
This guide was written after a lengthy process of learning from other mentors.  We recommend you continue this journey.

The trick to learning from the best mentors, is to learn from the best mentors *for you.*  Pick a company you love and would have loved to have helped, and ask them about their best mentors and advisors.  Those will be the best role models for you.

Our research process for this book included creating a Mentor Impact workshop, designed for 5-20 mentors to learn, and try, these techniques, and to share amongst themselves.  So much of the best mentoring is contextual, and our workshop is designed to expose and share what works in context.  

If you'd like a Mentor Impact workshop, we'd love to talk: [hello@source.institute](mailto:hello@source.institute)

You're also welcome to join our online forum.  [http://community.source.institute](http://community.source.institute)
