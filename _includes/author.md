Salim Virani works to empower startup founders on their own terms - from Roma people, to African engineers - even, as crazy as it may sound, Europeans.

He is the creator of Source Institute - an organisation that's making startup education better - mainly by pioneering peer to peer techniques.

Salim's work includes The Africa Prize For Engineering Innovation, which produces top-tier clean water, sanitation, education and agriculture startups across the continent, and The Sources, an online course where African founders share their most relevant experiences and advice. Salim founded Leancamp, which created the first evolutions of Lean Startup to include Business Models, UX, and Enterprise Lean Startup.  And Founder Centric, which developed and delivered startup education for Seedcamp, Techstars, ClimateKIC, and around 30 more accelerators and universities.

Source Institute believes that what works there doesn't always work here. We've found that in fast-changing environments, people improve faster when they learn from each other. Source Institute now spans 4 continents, involves 40 leaders operating 5 projects, educating thousands of founders.

Salim's also taught at a few smarty-pants universities like Oxford and UCL. Prior to that, Salim was the founder of 5 startups in ecommerce, email and IT services, as well as Digital Media Director at JWT, a major marketing agency.

Though in his parents eyes, he topped out at age 16, when we he was in the local newspaper for starting a computer store.
