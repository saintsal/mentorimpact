Startup mentors are experienced professionals and investors. But founders often leave mentoring more confused than they started. And they often miss the best advice.

So we did some research. We found the mentors that truly changed startups, and we asked them how they do it.

# About Mentor Impact


Working with some of the world's top accelerators, like Seedcamp and Techstars, we asked for the mentors who regularly make huge contributions to their startups, the ones that really change things.  We went to the best, and we asked them how they do it. 

What they told us was surprising -- it contradicted a lot of common knowledge.

Mentor Impact guides you through their different approaches, so you can find what works best for you:

* ways to calibrate your advice, to make sure it's actionable to startups
* different approaches to knowledge transfer
* tips on practicalities
* examples of unconventional mentoring approaches that work

This guide is very useful if you're new to startup mentoring, and has a number of new approaches for the experienced.

We want to help you meet startups where they stand and offer substantial, actionable help (not just opinions and advice). 

You're giving your valuable time and priceless expertise to help young founders - Mentor Impact will help you make it count.

# Mentor Impact workshops

Mentor Impact was originally designed as  workshop, so mentors can exchange ideas, reflect and discuss. It's a great way to inject some of the world's best mentorship thinking into your community, but also reveal the best mentoring approaches that work in your industry and culture. Mentor Impact workshops are designed to allow you and your mentors to deliver future workshops yourselves.
