Startup mentors are experienced professionals and investors. And yet, founders often leave mentoring more confused than they started, and they don't apply the best advice.

So we did some research. We found the mentors that truly changed startups, and we asked them how they do it.

# About Mentor Impact


Working with some of the world's top accelerators, like Seedcamp and Techstars, we asked for the mentors who regularly make huge contributions to their startups, the ones that really change things.  We went to the best, and we asked them how they do it. 

What they told us was surprising -- it contradicted a lot of common knowledge.

Mentor Impact guides you through their different approaches, so you can find what works best for you:

* ways to calibrate your advice, to make sure it's actionable to startups
* different approaches to knowledge transfer
* tips on practicalities
* examples of unconventional mentoring approaches that work

This guide is very useful if you're new to startup mentoring, and has a number of new approaches for the experienced.

We want to help you meet startups where they stand and offer substantial, actionable help (not just opinions and advice). 

You're giving your valuable time and priceless expertise to help young founders - Mentor Impact will help you make it count.

# About the author
<img src="public/img/salim.png" class="profile">

Salim Virani is the creator of Source Institute - an organisation that's making startup education better - mainly by pioneering peer to peer techniques.

We believe that works there doesn't always work here, and that founders improve faster when they learn from each other. Source Institute now spans 4 continents, involves 40 leaders operating 5 projects, educating thousands of founders.

Salim works to empower startup founders on their own terms - like Roma people, African engineers - and even Europeans.

Our work includes The Africa Prize For Engineering Innovation, which produces top-tier clean water, sanitation, education and agriculture startups across the continent, and The Sources, an online course where African founders share their most relevant experiences and advice. Salim founded Leancamp, which created the first evolutions of Lean Startup to include Business Models, UX, and Enterprise Lean Startup.  And Founder Centric, which developed and delivered startup education for Seedcamp, Techstars, ClimateKIC, and around 30 more accelerators and universities.

Salim's also taught at a few smarty-pants universities like Oxford and UCL. Prior to that, Salim was the founder of 5 startups in ecommerce, email and IT services, as well as Digital Media Director at JWT, a major marketing agency.

Though in his parents eyes, he topped out at age 16, when we he was in the local newspaper for starting a computer store.
