So far, I've got some really insightful and actionable feedback from around 5 people - lots of great suggestions that I can wait to write up.

My plan is to do some of that on my flight to Tanzania next week, so there should be another iteration in the works for you soon.

I'm also setting up a Thunderclap, with a view to an official book release in June.
