Thanks for your investment in startups!

So much about mentoring changes with the times, and as I hear from people around the world, I keep learning new approaches -- the best of which I'd like to share again so we can all benefit.  So, over time I'll be updating the book based on feedback and new research.

Whether you bought Mentor Impact, or it was shared with you, I'd like you to have the latest version with my compliments.  

Just click the button below, then "I want this".  A copy for $0 will be added to your cart and sent to you when you check out.

Thanks,

Salim Virani, author of Mentor Impact
